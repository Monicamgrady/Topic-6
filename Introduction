Topic-6

Introduction
In this, the final topic of the course, you will use all that you have learned so far to investigate the origin of life. Some scientific questions are of immediate and widespread interest, and they stir our imaginations. Two of these are the focus of this book:
•	How did life begin on Earth?
•	Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?
These questions have probably been considered ever since humans looked up at the night sky, but it is only in the last few years that we have made significant scientific progress towards answering them, and only in recent decades have huge strides been made. The name given to the study of the origin, evolution and distribution of life in the Universe is astrobiology. The theme of life in the Universe will be used to round off this course, showing how knowledge of the different subjects that you have studied and the skills that you have acquired are all necessary to help answer the above questions. The Open University is proud to be home to several teams of researchers who are actively engaged in the quest to understand life in the Universe.
